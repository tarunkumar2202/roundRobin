# roundrobin-prority-problem
Sudesh Sharma is a Linux expert who wants to have an online system where he can handle student queries. Since there can be multiple requests at any time he wishes to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request so that everyone gets a fair share of his time. He will log into the system from 10am to 12am only. He wants to have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for the same. The summary at the end of the session should include the total time he spent on handling queries and average query time.


Here Sudesh Sharma  is just like a CPU who need to handle process.
Multiple process can come at a single time in a fixed time duration. 
But CPU has fixed burst time to give process at a single time given 
By quanta. And There are 2 kinds processes Student and Faculty.
Faculty having  higher priority than students so they need to be solved first.
